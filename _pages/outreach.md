I am broadly interested in the profound interactions and the interconnected dynamics between our Earth's atmosphere and oceans shaping our weather and climate

I have worked under Dr. Bhupendra Singh at the [Centre for Climate Change and Research](http://cccr.tropmet.res.in/home/index.jsp) since July 2022 on projects related to precipitation extremes and exploring its changing dynamics in a warming climate.

Later I have worked under Prof. Vishal Dixit at the [Monsoon Dynamics Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/vishaldixit/group?authuser=0) in IIT Bombay since Aug 2023 to Jan 2024 on developing a relationship between near-surface air temperature and humidity and understand the mechanism leading to temperature extremes.

Currently, I have been working under Prof. Jim Thomas in the [GFD group](https://github.com/GFD-Tifr) at ICTS-TIFR and TIFR-CAM since Feb 2024 where I am working on understanding the energy flow pathways in the internal wave continuum in oceans. My ongoing research work is supported by the Summer Research Fellowship and the Long-Term Visiting Student Research Fellowship.
