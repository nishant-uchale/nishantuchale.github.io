Welcome! I am an atmospheric sciences student aspiring to explore weather and climate patterns on all scales and apply machine learning tools to meteorological data for better correlation.

I completed my B.E. Mechanical from the [University of Kashmir](https://www.kashmiruniversity.net/) in 2018, followed by M. Tech in Atmospheric Science from the [Savitribai Phule Pune University](https://www.unipune.ac.in) and the [Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology](https://tropmet.res.in) (IITM), Pune in 2021.

I did my dissertation at IITM Pune on Radar-based Quantitative Precipitation Estimation under the advisor Dr. M.C.R. Kalapureddy. I am currently pursuing a doctoral degree at the [Department of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences](https://eaps.purdue.edu), [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu), West Lafayette, USA, with [Prof. Dr. Daniel T. Dawson](https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/people/profile/dawson29.html).
