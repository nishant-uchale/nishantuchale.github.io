Hello and welcome to my profile! I am an enthusiastic atmospheric sciences student, driven by a deep-seated passion for understanding and predicting weather and climate patterns. My pursuit of this goal has led me to explore a diverse range of topics, from machine learning tools to meteorological data analysis and beyond.

As part of my journey, I have pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and a Master’s degree in Atmospheric Sciences from [Pune University](https://www.unipune.ac.in){:target="_blank"} and [Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology](https://tropmet.res.in){:target="_blank"} (IITM), Pune. During my time at IITM Pune, I worked on developing radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation techniques for my dissertation under the guidance of [Dr. M.C.R. Kalapureddy](https://www.tropmet.res.in/106-Madhu%20Chandra%20R.%20Kalapureddy-scientist_detail){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Kishore K. Grandhi]( https://uohyd.irins.org/profile/344518){:target="_blank"}. As a result of my work, I built [PyScanCf](https://syedha.com/PyScanCf/){:target="_blank"}, a Python Library that allows researchers to process radar data and perform advanced analysis.

Currently, I am a visiting research student at [Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence group](https://www.icts.res.in/research/fluid-dynamics){:target="_blank"}, [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS)]([https://purdue.edu](https://www.icts.res.in/)){:target="_blank"}, where I have the privilege of working under the expert guidance of [Prof. Jim Thomas](https://jimthomasedu.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. My research is focused on Geophysical Turbulence in Oceans with the ultimate goal of understanding the energy transfers in the internal-wave continuum.

With every new challenge and project, I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skills, and I believe that my passion for atmospheric sciences will continue to inspire me throughout my academic and professional journey. Thank you for taking the time to read my profile, and I look forward to connecting with others who share my passion for meteorology and the natural world.
