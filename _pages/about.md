Welcome to my profile! I am an enthusiastic atmosphere-ocean sciences student, fascinated by Clouds and Climate Dynamics. I like to see complex problems in atmosphere-ocean dynamics in terms of simple theoretical ideas based on basic physics and math with an aim to ultimately understand the underlying processes.

As part of my journey, I have pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and a Master’s degree in Atmospheric Sciences from [Pune University](https://www.unipune.ac.in){:target="_blank"} and [Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology](https://tropmet.res.in){:target="_blank"} (IITM), Pune. During my time at IITM Pune, I worked on understanding the characteristics and projected changes in global precipitation extremes in CMIP6 models for my dissertation under the guidance of [Dr. Bhupendra Singh](https://www.tropmet.res.in/127-Bhupendra%20Bahadur%20Singh-scientist_detail){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Pradeep K. Pallath](https://research.unipune.ac.in/User/User/Teacher_JournalList?TeacherId=BB52DE4C-759C-44BF-8DF9-B3434997849E){:target="_blank"}. As a result of my work, I have submitted my work in the Quaterly Journal of Royal Meteorological Society (QJRMS).

Currently, I am a visiting research student at [Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence group](https://www.icts.res.in/research/fluid-dynamics){:target="_blank"}, [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS)]([https://purdue.edu](https://www.icts.res.in/)){:target="_blank"}, where I have the privilege of working under the expert guidance of [Prof. Jim Thomas](https://jimthomasedu.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. My research is focused on Geophysical Turbulence in Oceans with the ultimate goal of understanding the energy transfers in the internal-wave continuum.

With every new challenge and project, I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skills, and I believe that my passion for atmosphere-ocean sciences will continue to inspire me throughout my academic and professional journey. Thank you for taking the time to read my profile, and I look forward to connecting with others who share my passion for meteorology and the natural world.
