Welcome to my profile! I am an ambitious atmospheric sciences student with a passion for exploring weather and climate patterns on all scales. I am constantly seeking to improve my knowledge and skills by applying machine learning tools to meteorological data in order to enhance numerical weather prediction.

My educational background includes a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Kashmir](https://www.kashmiruniversity.net/){:target="_blank"} and a Master's degree in Atmospheric Science from the prestigious [Savitribai Phule Pune University](https://www.unipune.ac.in){:target="_blank"} and [Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology](https://tropmet.res.in){:target="_blank"} (IITM), Pune. During my time at IITM Pune, I worked on Radar-based Quantitative Precipitation Estimation for my dissertation under the guidance of [Dr. M.C.R. Kalapureddy](https://www.tropmet.res.in/106-Madhu%20Chandra%20R.%20Kalapureddy-scientist_detail){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Kishore K. Grandhi](http://unipune.ac.in/FacultyProfile/FacultyProfile/VIEWRESUME.aspx?Emp_ID=9454){:target="_blank"}.

I did my dissertation at IITM Pune on Radar-based Quantitative Precipitation Estimation under the supervision of [Dr. M.C.R. Kalapureddy](https://www.tropmet.res.in/106-Madhu%20Chandra%20R.%20Kalapureddy-scientist_detail){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Kishore K. Grandhi](http://unipune.ac.in/FacultyProfile/FacultyProfile/VIEWRESUME.aspx?Emp_ID=9454){:target="_blank"}. I am currently pursuing a doctoral degree at the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences](https://eaps.purdue.edu), [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu){:target="_blank"}, West Lafayette, USA, with [Prof. Dr. Daniel T. Dawson](https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/people/profile/dawson29.html){:target="_blank"}.
