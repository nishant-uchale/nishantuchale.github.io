Research is central to my teaching because it allows students to improve their analytical skills and master data analysis tools through hands-on experience. I've instructedÂ courses in radar and satellite meteorology, as well as Python programming. While at Pune, I taught graduate students about scientific tools and software such as CDO, Basics of Matlab, Fortran95, GitHub, Ferret, and others. I also have a YouTube channel ["Wind Circulation"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj6KIezbXxTeTDB93KWMXZg), where I have a few technical videos for PyFerret and PyScanCf installation, and in the future, I plan to upload programming, atmospheric physics, and other lectures of interest.
