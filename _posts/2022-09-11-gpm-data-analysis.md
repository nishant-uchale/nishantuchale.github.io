Below are the links of the notebooks that will help you to get used to GPM data analysis with Python. Also, you can reach me via email <a href = "mailto: windcirculation@gmail.com">windcirculation@gmail.com</a> for any suggestions.

This notebook will introduce you to [DrPy Library](https://github.com/dopplerchase/DRpy){:target="_blank"}, developed by Dr. Randy Chase. It basically helps to read the data through the most popular python package called xarray, which gives us multi-dimensional labelled data.
