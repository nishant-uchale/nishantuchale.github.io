Global warming is primarily caused by carbon emissions. Why, how, and by whom are more carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) being produced in our atmosphere?

Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions caused by humans are one of our era’s defining phenomena. These emissions, the primary cause of global warming, also contribute to other types of climate change and ocean acidification. However, CO<sub>2</sub> production is not a level playing field across the globe. This section examines the available information on carbon emissions, including where they are produced, why they are produced, and how much is produced.

Human emissions vs. natural emissions
------
The ocean carbon cycle, the breakdown of organic matter, respiration, and volcanic eruptions all naturally release CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. In turn, natural sinks like forests and the ocean remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. However, since the Industrial Revolution, excessive human emissions have led to higher concentrations of the gas in the atmosphere than can be absorbed by current sinks. As a result, the atmosphere has warmed and is continuing to warm.
Human CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are minor when compared to natural sources. Approximately [750 gigatons](https://www.arcadia.com/energy-101/environmental-impact/greenhouse-gas-emissions-natural-vs-man-made/) (one gigaton = one billion tons) of CO<sub>2</sub> each year pass naturally through the carbon cycle. Humans currently produce an additional [36 gigatons](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions). Even though it is minor in comparison, it has a significant impact. Excess CO<sub>2</sub> disrupts the natural cycle and cannot be entirely absorbed by existing carbon sinks. When CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted from fossil fuels, roughly half of it remains in the atmosphere. At the same time, 25% is absorbed by plants and trees, and the remaining 25% is absorbed by the oceans. Human activities are responsible for almost [all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions) over the last 150 years.

Sources of carbon emissions
------
A wide range of industrial processes emit CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere, the most significant of which is the generation of electricity, heat, and transportation using fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. This accounts for [87 percent of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions caused by humans](https://www.che-project.eu/news/main-sources-carbon-dioxide-emissions). The remainder is derived from forest clearing and other land-use changes (nine percent), as well as some industrial processes such as cement manufacturing (four percent) and waste disposal (four percent) (including incineration).

Carbon emissions and global warming
------
It is now well understood that large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere cause it to heat up. CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs heat from the sun that would otherwise be reflected back into space. Some of this energy is re-emitted to Earth, causing additional global warming. Global temperatures have risen dramatically over the last few decades, reaching approximately 0.7°C above the 1961-1990 baseline. [Temperatures were 0.4°C colder in 1850. This results in an average temperature rise of 1.1°C](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#emissions-by-sector).

The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement set a target of keeping the rise in global average temperature to well below two degrees Celsius, with the goal of limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The world is falling short of this goal. To limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, carbon emissions would need to fall by around 15% per year until 2040.

[Current predictions suggest](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) that if current global policies are followed, temperatures will rise by around 3.0°C above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures will rise to around 2.8°C above pre-industrial levels if all unconditional pledges and targets set by governments are met.
