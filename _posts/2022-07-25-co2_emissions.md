Global warming is primarily caused by carbon emissions. Why, how, and by whom are more carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) being produced in our atmosphere?

C</span>arbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions caused by humans are one of our era’s defining phenomena. These emissions, the primary cause of global warming, also contribute to other types of climate change and ocean acidification. However, CO<sub>2</sub> production is not a level playing field across the globe. This section examines the available information on carbon emissions, including where they are produced, why they are produced, and how much is produced.

Human emissions vs. natural emissions
The ocean carbon cycle, the breakdown of organic matter, respiration, and volcanic eruptions all naturally release CO2 into the atmosphere. In turn, natural sinks like forests and the ocean remove CO2 from the atmosphere. However, since the Industrial Revolution, excessive human emissions have led to higher concentrations of the gas in the atmosphere than can be absorbed by current sinks. As a result, the atmosphere has warmed and is continuing to warm.
Human CO2 emissions are minor when compared to natural sources. Approximately [750 gigatons](https://www.arcadia.com/energy-101/environmental-impact/greenhouse-gas-emissions-natural-vs-man-made/) (one gigaton = one billion tons) of CO2 each year pass naturally through the carbon cycle. Humans currently produce an additional [36 gigatons](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions). Even though it is minor in comparison, it has a significant impact. Excess CO2 disrupts the natural cycle and cannot be entirely absorbed by existing carbon sinks. When CO2 is emitted from fossil fuels, roughly half of it remains in the atmosphere. At the same time, 25% is absorbed by plants and trees, and the remaining 25% is absorbed by the oceans. Human activities are responsible for almost [all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions) over the last 150 years.

A wide range of industrial processes emit CO2 into the atmosphere, the most significant of which is the generation of electricity, heat, and transportation using fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. This accounts for [87 percent of all CO2 emissions caused by humans](https://www.che-project.eu/news/main-sources-carbon-dioxide-emissions). The remainder is derived from forest clearing and other land-use changes (nine percent), as well as some industrial processes such as cement manufacturing (four percent) and waste disposal (four percent) (including incineration).
